# projeto-sudoku
Micro API built on node.js, the one responsible for solving the sudoku table.
Built entirely with node native tools, no external dependencies.

The original algorithm to solve the sudoku was extracted from Computerphile's Youtube channel and written in python

In this second version the algorithm is implemented with pure js.

## PT-BR ##
Micro API feita com node e um script python que resolve de fato o tabuleiro.
São utilizadas apenas as funções básicas do node.js, sem dependencias externas.

# TODO
- ~~Implement the solver with pure JS, replacing python script.~~
- Make the app look awesome.
